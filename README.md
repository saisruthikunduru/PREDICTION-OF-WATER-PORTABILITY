💧 Water Potability Prediction using Machine Learning
This project uses various machine learning algorithms to predict whether water is safe (potable) for drinking based on its physicochemical properties. The objective is to create an efficient and interpretable classification model to assess drinking water quality, promoting safer access to clean water worldwide.

🧪 Problem Statement
Access to safe drinking water is a global health priority. Contaminated water leads to diseases and long-term health issues. In this project, machine learning techniques are applied to analyze a dataset containing water quality parameters (e.g., pH, solids, chloramine, turbidity) to classify water as potable (1) or not (0).

📚 Dataset
The dataset includes 9 key features:

Feature	Description
pH	Acidity level of the water
Hardness	Mineral content like calcium/magnesium
Solids	Total dissolved solids (TDS)
Chloramines	Used to disinfect drinking water
Sulfate	Concentration of sulfate compounds
Conductivity	Water’s ability to carry electricity
Organic Carbon	Organic pollutants
Trihalomethanes	By-product of disinfection
Turbidity	Clarity of water based on suspended particles
Potability	Target variable (1 = potable, 0 = not potable)

🔍 Algorithms Used
✅ Logistic Regression

✅ Support Vector Machine (SVM)

✅ Naive Bayes

✅ Decision Tree

✅ XGBoost

✅ LightGBM (optional enhancement)

📊 Results Summary
Algorithm	Accuracy
Support Vector Machine	69.51%
XGBoost	65.54%
Naive Bayes	63.10%
Logistic Regression	62.80%
Decision Tree	58.38%

SVM and XGBoost gave the best results in terms of accuracy. However, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression remain simple and effective for basic deployment.
